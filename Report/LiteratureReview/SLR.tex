\section{Introduction}

The blind source separation problem refers to the process of recovering one or more signals that have been mixed in some unknown manner and possibly also contamined by noise. Without any assumptions on the mixing process, this problem is ill-poised. In practice therefore, all BSS methods rely on some stylized fact about the nature of the signals and/or the mixing process. It is therefore useful to dichotomize BSS methods by these assumptions.

Arguably, two of the most important facts characterizing a mixing process, are its temporal dynamics and the number of degrees of freedom. The first point refers to whether the nature of the mixing process changes over time, that is if the mixing matrix at time $t+k$ is different from that at time $t$ for $k>0$. The number of degrees of freedom is the same concept as in linear algebra - the connection is apparent by seeing the mixing process as a system of linear equations. If $m$ is the number of observed signals and $n$ the number of sources, the system is said to be \emph{underdetermined} if $m<n$ and conversely \emph{overdetermined} if $m>n$. 

We can also differentiate between method based on the nature of input data. Early BSS research often considered the case of $n=m$, which allows one to work with data in the time domain. For undetermined systems, it is commonplace to work with some transformation of the data, which in the case of audio data a time-frequency representation. Common methods include the \emph{short-term Fourier transform} and the \emph{wavelet transform}.

\section{Literature Overview}


\subsection{Independent Component Analysis} %% Ulf

%% Standard ICA
Among the most common approaches to blind source separation is
independent component analysis (ICA). Common definitions of ICA use
either the maximization of independence or minimization of mutual information between the source
signals\footnote{It should be noted that while this text presents ICA
  in terms of blind source separation, the method is applicable to a
  wide array of machine learning problems including dimension
  reduction, classification, and de-noising.}. Formally, we can state
the ICA problem in terms of a generative model of the observed signals
$\mathbf{x}$, and the unknown a mixing matrix $\mathbf{W}$ and source
signals $\mathbf{s}$:


\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{x} =   \mathbf{W}  \mathbf{s}
\end{equation}

The AIM of the ICA process is to estimate the inverse mixing process
along with the original signals.

The classical reference on ICA
is \cite{comon94}, where the method of minimization of mutual
information between sources is presented. \cite{comon94} also presents an
analysis of the ambiguities and limitations of ICA, hereunder the permutation of
sources, scaling and non-gaussianity. 

Computationally, ICA can be stated in many different forms,
hereunder neural networks (\cite{bellSejnowski95}),
maximum likelihood (\cite{pearlmutterParra}) and maximization of
non-gausianity as measured by excess kurtosis, which is used in the
popular FastICA algorithm (\cite{fastICA}). For a much more thorough survey on the classical literature on ICA, see \cite{hyvarinen2001}.

\subsection{ICA in Underdetermined Systems}
The classic studies on ICA focus to a large extent on developing the
formal framework for ICA, and examples are largely centered on time
domain analysis in systems of an equal number of sensors and
sources. ICA has however been extended to underdetermined systems and
the extreme case of single sensor systems. This involves transforming
the observed signals from the time domain to some other basis, the
most common of which are the frequency domain (Fourier transform), the
time-frequency domain (short-term Fourier transform) and the wavelet domain.
